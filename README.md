Distributed System 
      gRPC 

Implementation: Command-line / GUI

This project provides a basic Java programmerâ€™s introduction  gRPC.

By walking through we will see:
  A service in a .proto file.
  Server and client code using the protocol buffer compiler.
  Java gRPC API - Simple client and server

  Send to the user the weather forecast

Your Connection
  Receive from the client some information

Smart Devices
  Respond to the user that the component has switched on/off.

Version 1.0 - Command-Line
Version 1.1 - GUI by Java Swing
---



Version 2.0 - GUI by JavaFX
--
Once I finished my project. To improve my learning, I will develop a new version that reinforces gRPC concepts
and learn about a new topic JavaFX.

This version includes the following services:
Proto -> Utilities 
      * Service: DomesticUtilitiesServices
            # Method: Energy Monitor ->  Approach: Service-Side Streaming RPC
            # Method: Disable Energy Monitor -> Approach: Unary RPC
      
Proto -> Environment
      * Service: Environment Mgmt Services
            # Method: Switch On -> Approach: Service-Side Streaming RPC
            # Method: SwitchOff -> Approach: Unary RPC
            # Method: Forecast -> Approach: Unary RPC
            
Proto -> Security
      * Service: SmartDoorServices
            # Method: OpenDoor -> Approach: Unary RPC
            # Method: Close Door -> Approach: Unary RPC
            .
      * Service: SmartAlarmServices
            # Method: TurnOnAlarm -> Approach: Service-Side Streaming RPC
            # Method: TurnOffAlarm -> Approach: Unary RPC
